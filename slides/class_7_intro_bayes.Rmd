## Who was Bayes?

*An essay towards solving a problem on the doctrine of chances* (1763)

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$

## What is Bayesian statistics?

- Bayesian statistics is based on an interpretation of Bayes' theorem
- All quantities are divided up into _data_ (i.e. things which have been observed) and _parameters_ (i.e. things which haven't been observed)
- We use Bayes' interpretation of the theorem to get the _posterior probability distribution_, the probability of the unobserved given the observed
- Used now in almost all areas of statistical application (finance, medicine, environmetrics, gambling, etc, etc)

## Why Bayes?

The Bayesian approach has numerous advantages:

- It's easier to build complex models and to analyse the parameters you want directly
- We automatically obtain the best parameter estimates and their uncertainty from the posterior samples
- It allows us to get away from (terrible) null hypothesis testing and $p$-values

## Bayes theorem in english

Bayes' theorem can be written in words as:

$$\mbox{posterior is proportional to likelihood times prior}$$
... or ...
$$\mbox{posterior} \propto \mbox{likelihood} \times \mbox{prior}$$
  
Each of the three terms _posterior_, _likelihood_, and _prior_ are _probability distributions_ (pdfs).

In a Bayesian model, every item of interest is either data (which we will write as $x$) or parameters (which we will write as $\theta$). Often the parameters are divided up into those of interest, and other _nuisance parameters_

## Bayes theorem in maths

Bayes' equation is usually written mathematically as:
$$p(\theta|x) \propto p(x|\theta) \times p(\theta)$$
or, more fully:
$$p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(x|\theta) \times p(\theta)}{p(x)}$$

- The _posterior_ is the probability of the parameters given the data
- The _likelihood_ is the probability of observing the data given the parameters (unknowns)
- The _prior_ represents external knowledge about the parameters

## A very simple linear regression example

Suppose you had some data that looked like this:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat = read.csv('../data/earnings.csv')
with(dat, plot(x_centered, y))
```

## What you are used to doing

\tiny
```{r}
mod_lm = lm(y ~ x_centered, data = dat)
summary(mod_lm)
```
\normalsize

## What you will now get instead

\tiny
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rstanarm)
mod_stan = stan_lm(y ~ x_centered, data = dat,
               prior = R2(location = 0.5, 'mean'))
mod_stan
```

## And yet more detail

\tiny
```{r}
summary(mod_stan)
```

## And in a slightly neater format

```{r}
posterior_interval(mod_stan)
```

## Using prior information

- The Bayesian model (hidden in `stan_lm`) divided up everything into _parameters_ (the intercept, slope and residual standard deviation), and data (the height and log(earnings) values)
- The software in the background created a posterior probability distribution of the parameters given the data
- The model I fitted used vague _prior information_. However, if we had done a previous experiment that suggested that the mean $R^2$ value should be around 0.01 we can put that into the model

## With prior information

```{r, message=FALSE}
mod_stan_2 = stan_lm(y ~ x_centered, data = dat,
               prior = R2(location = 0.01, 'mean'))
posterior_interval(mod_stan_2)
```

## What's really happening in the background

- `rstanarm` uses `rstan` to produce these posterior distributions
- The idea of `rstanarm` is to make it easy to switch from traditional modelling packages (e.g. `lme4`) to Bayesian ones without too many code changes
- However it does have some very odd ideas about how people include prior information, and is somewhat overly mathematical in its documentation

## The real `stan` code

\scriptsize
```{r, eval = FALSE}
stan_code = '
data {
  int N;
  vector[N] x;
  vector[N] y;
}
parameters {
  real intercept;
  real slope;
  real<lower=0> residual_sd;
} 
model {
  // Likelihood
  y ~ normal(intercept + slope * x, residual_sd);
  // Priors
  intercept ~ normal(0, 100);
  slope ~ normal(0, 100);
  residual_sd ~ uniform(0, 100);
}
'
```

## Understanding the different parts of a Bayesian model

- The likelihood is the probability of observing the data given the parameters. It represents the _data generating process_
- The prior is the probability distribution of the parameters independent from the current data you have been generated. It often requires care (and philosophy) to choose. More on this later
- The posterior is the probability distribution of the parameters given the data. It is always the target of our inference
- The two software packages we will explore (`rstanarm` and `rstan`), create the posterior distribution for us

## Lots of probability distributions

Almost always, the likelihood and prior can be picked from the standard probability distributions:

\tiny
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}lp{4cm}}
\hline
Distribution & Range of parameter & Useful for \\
\hline
Normal, $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ & $(-\infty,\infty$) & A good default choice \\
Uniform, $U(a,b)$ & $(a,b)$ & Vague priors when we only know the range of the parameter \\
Binomial, $Bin(k,\theta)$ & $[0,k]$ & Count or binary data restricted to have an upper value \\
Poisson, $Po(\lambda)$ & $[0,\infty)$ & Count data with no upper limit \\
Gamma, $Ga(\alpha,\beta)$ & $(0,\infty)$ & Continuous data with a lower bound of zero \\
Multivariate Normal, $MVN(\mu,\Sigma)$ & $(-\infty,\infty$) & Multivariate unbounded data with correlation between parameters/observations \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\normalsize
The more probability distributions you know the better you will be at Bayes!

## Practical differences between frequentist statistics and Bayes

- In frequentist statistics you tend to get a single best estimate of a parameter and a standard error, often assumed normally distributed, and a p-value
- In Bayesian statistics you get a large set of samples of the parameter values which match the data best. You get to choose what you do with these
- In frequentist statistics if the p-value is less than 0.05 you win. If not you cry and try a different model
- In Bayesian statistics you try to quantify the size of an effect from the posterior distribution, or find a particular posterior probability, e.g. P(slope > 0 given the data). 

## Choosing a likelihood and a prior

- The key to choosing a likelihood is to pick a probability distribution which matches your data, e.g. if it's a continuous measurement and is unbounded then a normal distribution. If it's count data bounded above and below then a Binomial might be appropriate
- The key to choosing a prior distribution is to choose values which you believe represent the reasonable range that the parameter can take, or come from a related study in the literature
- Again, use an _informative prior_ if possible

Note: the shape of the distribution of the response variable is usually completely unimportant when choosing the likelihood!

## `rstan` vs `rstanarm`

We will be using two different software tools to calculate posterior distributions. These represent the state of the art for user-friendly, research quality Bayesian statistics.

- `rstan` positives: very flexible, uses sensible distribution names, everything is declared, lots of documentation support, written by people at the top of the field
- `rstan` negatives: cannot have discrete parameters, some odd declaration choices, slower to run code, code tends to be longer
- `rstanarm` positives: very quick for simple models, code looks very similar to `lme4`, no declarations required
- `rstanarm` negatives: confusing prior distributions, not as well documented, not as much flexibility in model choice

## Calculating the posterior vs sampling from it

- There are two ways to get at a posterior:

    1. Calculate it directly using hard maths
    2. Use a simulation method

- Number 1 is impractical once you move beyond a few parameters, so number 2 is used by almost everybody
- This means that we create _samples_ from the posterior distribution. Here are three samples from the earnings example:

\tiny
```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(as.data.frame(mod_stan), 3)
```

\normalsize

- We often create thousands of posterior samples to represent the posterior distribution

## Things you can do with posterior samples

- Create histograms or density plots:
- Individual summaries such as means, standard deviations, and quantiles (e.g. 95% confidence intervals)
- Joint summaries such as scatter plots or correlations
- Transformations such as logs/exponents, squares/square roots, etc

The posterior distribution will usually be stored in a matrix where each row is a sample, and each column is a different parameter. Having the posterior distribution enables you to get at exactly the quantities you are interested in

## Summary so far: for and against Bayes

For:

- A Bayesian model can be simply displayed as a likelihood and a prior. Everything is explicit
- Stan finds the posterior distribution for us so we don't need to do any maths
- We can get exactly the quantity we are interested in, the probability distribution of our unknowns given our knowns

Against:

- It can be hard to create a prior distribution (and a likelihood)
- Not having p-values can make papers harder to publish (but this is changing)


## Checking assumptions (e.g. residuals)

- Sometimes people, because Bayesian modelling seems much richer and incorporates more information, think that their model is perfect
- In reality we need to check our assumptions. This may include:

1. Checking residuals in a linear regression model
1. Checking whether the parameter values actually match the data
1. Seeing whether a simpler or richer model might fit the data better

Some of this we will cover in later classes, but e.g. traditional residual analysis for linear regression is still important here

## The danger of vague priors

- Suppose you use the prior distribution `intercept ~ normal(0, 100)` in Stan because you had very little information about the intercept. Is this a reasonable thing to do? Do you honestly believe that the intercept might be as small as -200 or as big as 200?
- If you fit a model and the parameters do not match your views about the data, there must be some information you have not encoded in the prior, go back and change it!
- In more complex models, you need the prior to constrain some of the parameters so that the model will fit. These are known as _regularisation_ priors
- Use an _informative prior_ when you can

## Replication in Science and the horror of p-values

- We want our findings to be reproducible. We don't want to publish something which is only true for our own data
- Unfortunately p-values do not do this because:

1. A p-value is essentially a function of the sample size. If you want a smaller p-value simply collect more data
1. A p-value tells you nothing about the null hypothesis. It's a probability on the data assuming the null hypothesis is true!
1. The null hypothesis is never true. It's a straw man that is waiting to be knocked down by your data

Bayesian hierarchical modelling is a great way to stop using p-values and start doing reproducible science

## General tips

- If you have lots of disparate data, try to build one model for all it. You'll be able to _borrow strength_ from the data (e.g. in a hierarchical model) and reduce the uncertainty in your parameter estimates

- Try your hardest to use informative priors, and always justify the values you use (especially when trying to publish). In this course we're presenting generic examples so have almost always used vague priors

- Check your model. Many of the usual requirements from traditional statistics (e.g. residual checks) are still relevant in the Bayesian world. There are some extra Bayesian tricks we can also do; discussed in later classes

## Summary

- Bayesian statistical models involve a _likelihood_ and a _prior_. These both need to be carefully chosen. From these we create a posterior distribution

- The likelihood represents the information about the data generating process; the prior information about the unknown parameters

- We usually create and analyse samples from the posterior probability distribution of the unknowns (the parameters) given the knowns (the data)

- From the posterior distribution we can create means, medians, standard deviations, credible intervals, etc, from samples we take using e.g. `rstanarm` or `rstan`
